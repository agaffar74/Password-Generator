#Password-Generator

##Description of the Project
An application that the client can use to generate a random password based on criteria they’ve selected from the option at the beggining. This app will run in the browser. It will have a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

##Goal of the Project
This was a learning challange for creating an app that randomly generates a password based on defined criteria ensuring strong security. Learned to execute the app in the browser that features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I have written.

Scope of Work
1.	User will click the button to generate a password
2.	After clicking the user will be prompted with questions regarding a. criteria & b. options for password:
•	Criteria:
•	Must be between 8 and 128 characters long
•	Must choose at least 1 of the character options:
o	numbers
o	lower case letter
o	upper case letter
o	and/or special character
•	Options:
•	User chooses length of PW within the criteria
•	User can choose which/some/or all of the PW character choices: (must include at least 1 option per criteria above)
o	numbers
o	lower case letter
o	upper case letter
o	special character
3.	Upon answering the prompts the password will generate and appear in the box.
