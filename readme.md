# **Password-Generator**

## Description of the Project
An application that the client can use to generate a random password based on criteria theyâ€™ve selected from the option at the beggining. This app will run in the browser. It will have a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

## Goal of the Project
This was a learning challange for creating an app that randomly generates a password based on defined criteria ensuring strong security. Learned to execute the app in the browser that features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I have written.

## Scope of Work

**User will click the button to generate a password**
